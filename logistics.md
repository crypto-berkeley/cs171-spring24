## About CS 171

Cryptography or cryptology is the science of designing algorithms and protocols for enabling parties to communicate and compute securely in an untrusted environment (e.g. secure communication, digital signature, etc.) Over the last four decades, cryptography has transformed from an ad hoc collection of mysterious tricks into a rigorous science based on firm complexity-theoretic foundations. This modern complexity-theoretic approach to cryptography will be the focus. E.g., in the context of encryption we will begin by giving a precise mathematical definition for what it means to be a secure encryption scheme and then give a construction (realizing this security notion) assuming various computational hardness assumptions (e.g. factoring).

## Class Announcements & HW Submission

We will be using this Piazza for all announcements and Gradescope for grading (uploading homeworks and grading of midterms and finals). **Please use** **entry code 2PY8Y4 for joining the class on Gradescope.** All homeworks will be due at 8:59 PM on the due-date. Please try to submit your homework on time. However, we understand that unforeseen difficulties may arise, so we have the following policy on late submissions. We hope that you will not need to use this policy. And please note that no exceptions whatsoever will be made to this policy.

*   Late policy: (updated) Assignments submitted late will lose 5% for every hour that they are late. For example: If you submit 1 minute late on an assignment worth 80 points, you lose 4 points (5% of 80). If you submit 61 minutes late, you lose 8 points (10%).
*   Homework drop policy: Best x-2 (out of x). For example, if 10 homeworks are given then we will score the best 8.

## DSP Accomodations

We encourage DSP students to have their accommodation letters sent to the instructor within the first two weeks of class. Additionally, please send emails to bhaskarr@berkeley.edu for logistics on homework and exam submissions. _**Exam dates and policies**_ Please keep the following time slots free for any exam related activities.

*   Midterm I: Feb 14th (During class, Soda 306).
*   Midterm II: Mar 20th (During class, Soda 306).
*   Final: May 7th, 2024 (7 pm to 10 pm, Location TBD).

## Prerequisites

The only formal prerequisite is a course on discrete mathematics (CS70). Specifically, we will assume familiarity with basic (discrete) probability and modular arithmetic. Students enrolled are also expected to have had some exposure to algorithms, mainly to be comfortable reading pseudocode and to be familiar with big-O notation. 

## Collaboration

You are encouraged to work on homework problems with fellow students; however, you must always write up the solutions on your own. Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, but you must always credit all such sources in your write-up and you must never copy material verbatim. However, as a general rule of thumb, you should never possess solutions to exact homework questions other than those solutions you have written yourself. We realize that it is sometimes possible to stumble upon solutions on accident. If this happens, please cite the source and write up solutions in your own words. We believe that most students can distinguish between helping other students and cheating. Explaining the meaning of a question, discussing a way of approaching a solution, or collaboratively exploring how to solve a problem within your group are types of interaction that we strongly encourage. But you should write your homework solution strictly by yourself so that your hands and eyes can help you internalize this material. At no time should you be in possession of another student’s solution. You may discuss approaches but your solution must be written by you and you only. You should explicitly acknowledge everyone whom you have worked with or who has given you any significant ideas about the homework. Further, it is your responsibility to ensure that your solutions will not be visible to other students. If you use Github or any other source control system to store your solutions electronically, you must ensure your account is configured so your solutions are not publicly visible. Many popular version control systems provide free repositories to students; staff members or fellow students can help you obtain one. As a final note, we’d like to point out that collaboration on homework, while encouraged, can be detrimental to your learning if misused. In particular, avoid collaborations where you do not contribute enough to your own satisfaction. Such a collaboration not only cheats you out of an opportunity to learn through homework, but can also affect your confidence. If you feel that you are not contributing enough to your group, then try to spend time thinking about the problems alone before working with your group. If you end up solving the problem all by yourself that’s great! And if not, you’ll still be prepared to better contribute to your group. If you’re ever in doubt about what constitutes academic dishonesty, always ask a TA or on Piazza. _Warning_: You should be aware that copying or sharing solutions, in whole or in part, from other students in the class (or any other source without acknowledgment) constitutes cheating. Any student found to be cheating risks automatically failing the class and being referred to the Office of Student Conduct. Please find more information below. 

## Inclusion

We are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students. To do so, we intend to support a diversity of perspectives and experiences and respect each others’ identities and backgrounds (including race/ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, etc.). To help accomplish this:

*   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by a lack of inclusion, please contact the instructors, your ESS advisor, or the departmental Faculty Equity Advisor (list and information [here](https://diversity.berkeley.edu/faculty-equity-advisors)). An anonymous feedback form is also available [here](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/about/equity-and-inclusion/feedback/).

*   If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from your legal name, designate a preferred name for use in the classroom [here](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/academic-records/your-name-records-rosters).
*   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class (e.g., family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with the instructor(s). We want to be resources for you.

*   We are all in the process of learning how to respect and include diverse perspectives and identities. Please take care of yourself and those around you as we work through the challenging but important learning process.

*   As a participant in this class, recognize that you can be proactive about making other students feel included and respected.

## Berkeley Honor Code

Everyone in this class is expected to adhere to this code: “As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” 

## Student Conduct

Ethical conduct is of utmost importance in your education and career. The instructors, the College of Engineering, and U.C. Berkeley are responsible for supporting you by enforcing all students’ compliance with the [Code of Student Conduct](https://sa.berkeley.edu/code-of-conduct) and the policies listed in the [CoE Student Guide](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-guide/policies-procedures/). The Center for Student Conduct is set up to support you when you have been affected by actions that may violate these community rules. This includes an organized and transparent process, student participation in the process, mechanisms for appeals, and [other mechanisms to protect fairness](https://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct). 

## Accommodation Policy

We honor and respect the different learning needs of our students, and are committed to ensuring you have the resources you need to succeed in our class. If you need accommodations for any reason (e.g. religious observance, health concerns, insufficient resources, etc.) please discuss with your instructor or academic advisor how to best support you. We will respect your privacy under state and Federal laws, and you will not be asked to share more than you are comfortable sharing. The disabled student program is a related resource, listed below.
