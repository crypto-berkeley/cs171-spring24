## DSP Accomodations

*   Midterm I: Feb 14th (During class, Soda 306).

*   Final: May 7th, 2024 (7 pm to 10 pm, Location TBD).

## Inclusion

We are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students. To do so, we intend to support a diversity of perspectives and experiences and respect each others’ identities and backgrounds (including race/ethnicity, nationality, gender identity, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, etc.). To help accomplish this:

*   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by a lack of inclusion, please contact the instructors, your ESS advisor, or the departmental Faculty Equity Advisor (list and information [here](https://diversity.berkeley.edu/faculty-equity-advisors)). An anonymous feedback form is also available [here](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/about/equity-and-inclusion/feedback/).

*   If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from your legal name, designate a preferred name for use in the classroom [here](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/academic-records/your-name-records-rosters).
*   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class (e.g., family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with the instructor(s). We want to be resources for you.

*   We are all in the process of learning how to respect and include diverse perspectives and identities. Please take care of yourself and those around you as we work through the challenging but important learning process.

*   As a participant in this class, recognize that you can be proactive about making other students feel included and respected.

## Accommodation Policy

We honor and respect the different learning needs of our students, and are committed to ensuring you have the resources you need to succeed in our class. If you need accommodations for any reason (e.g. religious observance, health concerns, insufficient resources, etc.) please discuss with your instructor or academic advisor how to best support you. We will respect your privacy under state and Federal laws, and you will not be asked to share more than you are comfortable sharing.
